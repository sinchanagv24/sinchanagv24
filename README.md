# üöÄ Hi, I'm Sinchana!

I‚Äôm an **AI & Data Science Engineer** with a Master‚Äôs in **Data Science** from the **University of Maryland, College Park** üéì  
I specialize in building **end-to-end AI/ML pipelines**, integrating **LLMs and agentic workflows** into enterprise systems, and deploying data-driven solutions on the cloud.

---

## üí° What I Do

- Build **agentic AI workflows** with large language models (LLMs) to automate complex business processes.  
- Design and deploy **real-time data pipelines** and automation systems using **AWS, GCP, and Snowflake**.  
- Deliver **insightful dashboards** with Power BI, Tableau, and Streamlit for decision making.  
- Develop, fine-tune, and evaluate **deep learning and NLP models** for practical use cases (from invoices to poetry).
